# C-App-Recursive-function-for-finding-reflective-pair-in-an-array
The functionality of this C application is described as follows.
* The program asks from the user to enter the elements of an array of integers. The user is able to enter as many integers as he likes. He can also enter just one integer.
* After that the program runs the recursive function "find_Reflective_Pair" to check if the array entered by the user has a reflective pair that has a sum of the pair elements equal to the 1st element of the array. A reflective pair is a pair of numbers that lying in symmetric slots in the array of integers. (e.g. reflective pair is the 1st and the last element of the array, the 2nd and the second to last element etc). Now if the array has an odd number of elements we consider that the reflective pair of the element in the middle is the element itself. For example if we have the array **A = [25 4 6 15 19 46 36]** the reflective pair (6,19) has a sum of 25 which equals the 1st element of A, A(0). The function "find_Reflective_Pair" returns the position of the 1st element of the reflective pair that satisfies the above condition. Otherwise, the function returns -1.
* The program prints in to the function "find_Reflective_Pair" a message with the 2 elements of the reflective pair that satisfy the above condition or an appropriate message in case there is no reflective pair.
